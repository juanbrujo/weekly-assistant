This NodeJS script (by now) helps me to build the [CSSLab Weekly newsletter](http://www.csslab.cl/csslab-weekly/) that takes me at least 2 hours of my weekly time. 

So I'm automating some things and some of them is being added to this 🤖 Assistant.

- **v0.0.2**: better callbacks. bugfix screenshot url.
- **v0.0.1**: scrapes a list of sites (*.js array*) and get title, description and screenshot of each one of them. Saves them to a specific folder.

## USE:

Clone and:

```
$ cd csslab-weekly-assistant
$ npm install
// start
$ node .
```

### TO-DO:

- ask for new directory and use it to save new files ([inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer))
- <s>better callbacks</s> (thanks @lgaticaq!)
